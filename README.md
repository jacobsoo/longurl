longurl
=======

Produces the actual url for most shortened url(s)

longurl is just a tool that i used frequently to check all those shortened url(s) that i've received from work, emails and other places.
It is an attempt to check whether the shortened url(s) contained any malicious stuff and possibly unmasking new malicious malware.
